Octolog provides a complete[^1] API for Github [workflow commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions) that makes it easy to create powerful Github Actions that create readable logs. 

 and makes it possible to signal conditions from within R that will create annotations when used within Github Actions but raise normal R conditions
when used interactively.

[^1]: The only exception is [`save-state`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#sending-values-to-the-pre-and-post-actions) which can only be used in JavaScript actions. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of octolog with either of these options:

``` r
pak::pak("assignUser/octolog")
devtools::install_github("assignUser/octolog")
```

## What are *Github Actions*?
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful,free[^2] [CI](https://devguide.ropensci.org/ci.html) service integrated into every repository on Github. You can use actions created by other users (e.g. the very popular [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) collection of R related actions) or create your own customized workflow that fits your needs.

[^2]: For public repositories.

## Example

The best way to see how {octolog} works, is in an actual [workflow](https://github.com/assignUser/octolog/actions/workflows/test-octolog.yaml). For more information please see the [website](assignUser.github.io/octolog) and the vignette [LINK ME]().
